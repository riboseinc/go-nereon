= Nereon in Go (go-nereon)

Nereon in Go (`go-nereon`) is part of the https://github.com/riboseinc/nereon[Nereon project]
for configuration management.

This Go library provides tools for using the
https://github.com/riboseinc/event-configuration-models[Nereon configuration models].

== Purpose

This library allows you to define all the following aspects using a unified,
single configuration specification:

* Environment variables for configuration
* Configuration file syntax parsing
* Command-line configuration options


== Syntax

The Nereon configuration syntax is loosely based on
https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl[HCL] and
https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl[UCL],
who themselves are based on a JSON-like syntax inspired by `nginx`.


== Usage

More information to come.


== Examples

TBD.


== Sample projects

https://github.com/riboseinc/kaohi[Kaohi] is a logging daemon that uses
`go-nereon` to define configuration options.
